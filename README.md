Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity to collect and exchange data. IoT devices are becoming increasingly common in our lives, and they are generating a massive amount of data. This data is valuable for businesses and individuals, but it can also be a target for attackers.
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to monitor networks for malicious activity. IDSs can be used to detect a wide range of attacks, including unauthorized access, data modification, and denial of service attacks. However, IDSs can be expensive to deploy and maintain, and they can generate a lot of false positives.
This project proposes a new intrusion detection system for IoT devices. The proposed system uses a combination of color harmony algorithm, convolution neural network, enhanced identity based encryption, and wild horse algorithm. The color harmony algorithm is used to extract features from the data collected by the IoT devices. The Convolution neural network is used to classify the extracted features as malicious or benign. The enhanced identity based encryption is used to encrypt the data collected by the IoT devices. The wild horse algorithm is used to optimize the performance of the IDS.
The proposed system is designed to be efficient and effective in detecting intrusions in IoT devices. The system is also designed to be scalable and adaptable to new threats.




The key contribution of this project is summarized below, 

1. In this model development process, the CNN-AWHSE-ST-IoT Method is proposed.
2. Primarily, the input data is taken from the NSL-KDD dataset. 
3. In the initial step, the input data of the NSL-KDD dataset is pre-processed. The pre- processing stage includes three stages. The crisp data conversion, splitting, and normalization are performed in this process. 4. The CHA is used to choose the significant features of the pre-processed data. 
5. After feature selection, the chosen features are given to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, which classifies the attack and non-attack (Normal data).
6. After guessing the results, with the support of EIBE, they are sent to the user.
7. To transmit the data safely, the EIBE is optimized with the help of Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO).
8. After transmitting the data securely, the results of the normal data are showed on the monitor.
9. The CNN-AWHSE-ST-IoT method is implemented in PYTHON, and the efficiency of the proposed method is projected with the support of numerous evaluating metrics like accuracy, Cumulative accuracy, Computational time, Encryption Time, Decryption Time and Security.
